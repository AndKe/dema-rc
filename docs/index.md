"Linux Drone Remote Controller" or **dema-rc** is a software for
drone Remote Control using WiFi rather than traditional RF protocols. It can be
used in any computer running Linux with a joystick, including "embedded" boards
like Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone, etc.

Also there are commercial off-the-shelf controllers supported:
the current focus of the project is supporting **Parrot SkyController 2**.
Other versions and controllers may be supported, but not without
changing the code.
